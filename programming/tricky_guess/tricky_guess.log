    In this tricky game we have randomized a word out of a given wordlist.
    Your job is to guess that word.
    On each guess we will provide you number of characters you were correct with,
    without any indication upon what characters or their position.
    You have multiple limitations though:
    - On each run a new word is randomized.
    - You have 15 tries.
    - We are limiting the connection to 30 seconds.

    To block bruteforce we will show you the next cat and wait...
